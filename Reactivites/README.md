# Reactivities

THis course has helped me to learn these new framworks and I Have done this project as a part of my Software Engineering project CIS 634.

To run this project,
1. In one termianl run the backend by navigating to Reactivites/API and type dotnet run. 
   this would download the necessary files update. localhost:/5000
2. In other terminal run the front by navigating to Reactivites/client-app and type npm i, then npm start
   this would download the necessary files update. localhost/3000
