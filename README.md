# Reactivities
A meet-up similar to project sing .net 6 and react
This course has helped me to learn this new framework and I have done this project as a part of my Software Engineering project CIS 634.

To run this project,

In one terminal run the backend by navigating to Reactivites/API and type dotnet run. this would download the necessary files update. localhost:/5000
In other terminal run the front by navigating to Reactivites/client-app and type npm i, then npm start this would download the necessary files update. localhost/3000
